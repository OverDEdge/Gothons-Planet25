# Gothons-Planet25
Python Games based on 'Gothons from Planet Percal #25'

This Python Game has been created using the code from "Learn Python the Hard Way" ex43: 'Gothons from Planet Percal #25'.
The existing rooms are the same:
- Central Corridor
- Weapon Armory
- The Bridge
- Escape Pod

What has been added is:
- Possibility of simple fighting mechanic with the Gothons
- Possibility of cheating through the harder parts
- Decreased the difficulty of guessing the random code for the bomb and finding the correct Escape Pod. This is easily adjustable.
- Listing possible action across the rooms.
